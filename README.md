# Reddit Web Scraper
This web scraper program takes data from reddit.com/r/politics and analyzes the headlines of trending articles. It then assigns a sentiment value
of either positive, negative, or neutral and organizes the values into a bar plot to show the sentiment of trending news in that day.
In addition it also organizes headlines into a csv to be pulled as data for any future or related projects.
